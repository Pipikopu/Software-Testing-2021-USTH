*__Question:__  Define mutation score.*

*__Answer:__*<br>
The mutation score is the ratio of dead mutants over the total number of non-equivalent mutants. 
If the mutation score reaches 1.00, that means all mutants have been detected. 
A test set that kills all the mutants is said to be adequate relative to the mutants.
